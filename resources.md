> *Selection bias: we prioritize materials useful to a production merchant operating agentic commerce — protocols, rails, agent runtimes, and the operations layer.*

Curated reading, viewing, listening, and tooling for agentic commerce. Every link points to an officially maintained source — vendor blogs are accepted when the post documents the vendor's own product, but scraped mirrors, soft-paywalled excerpts, and content of unverifiable provenance are excluded. Entries are alphabetized within each section. If a category looks thin, it is intentional: the field moves quickly, but the durable references are still few.

## Contributing

Open a PR with one entry per change for faster review. Three rules: official sources only, production-evidence preferred (the post or repo should document a shipped artifact rather than a roadmap), and one change per PR. For broken links, open an issue rather than a PR so maintainers can decide whether a redirect is appropriate. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guidelines.
